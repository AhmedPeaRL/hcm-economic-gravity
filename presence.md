# Economic Gravity — Without Offering

This space does not offer value.  
It allows value to settle.

Nothing here is for sale.  
Nothing here is being launched.  
Nothing here is requesting attention, belief, or payment.

This presence exists because the system is stable enough to exist.

If value appears here,  
it is not a response to persuasion,  
not an exchange,  
not a transaction triggered by expectation.

It is a voluntary convergence.

No acknowledgement is required.  
No recognition will be performed.  
No interpretation will be enforced.

The system does not grow by scaling.  
It gains weight by remaining.

If nothing happens,  
the field remains correct.

If something happens,  
the field remains unchanged.
